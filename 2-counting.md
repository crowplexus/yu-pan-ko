# Counting Numbers
### Base Numbers
The counting system uses a base 6 numbering system, the numbers are
- 0 - yushū
- 1 - panū
- 2 - tenū
- 3 - fupū
- 4 - hayū
- 5 - nimū

---
### Beyond Five
After five, grab the first syllable of your highest number (i.e: nimū) and combine the next number with it (i.e: panū)
- 6 - nipanū (five one / six)
- 7 - nitenū (five two / seven)
- 8 - nifupū (five three / eight)
- 9 - nihayū (five four / nine)

---
### Beyond Ten
After nine, grab the first syllable of the next number
- i.e: if the next number is ten, then we get: panū, or more specifically "pa",
then put the last syllable of zero after it ("shū"), and continue from there
- 10 - pashū (one and zero / ten)
- 11 - pashupanū (one zero and one / eleven)
- 12 - pashutenū (one zero and two / twelve)
...
- 16 - pashunipanū (one zero five one / sixteen)
- 17 - pashunitenū (one zero five two / seventeen)
- 18 - pashunifupū (one zero five three / eighteen)
...
- 20 - teshū (two and zero / twenty)
- 21 - teshupanū (two zero and one / twenty-one)
- 22 - teshutenū (two zero and two / twenty-two)
...
- 30 - fushū (three and zero / thirty)
- 40 - hashū (four and zero / forty)
- 50 - nishū (five and zero / fifty)

---
### Beyond Fifty
Using what was established before, in this case, we need to once again, grab the first syllable of our highest number, grab the first syllable of the next number, add zero (shū), and continue on
- 60 - nipashū
- 61 - nipashupanū
- 62 - nipashutenū
...
- 70 - nitenushū
- 80 - nifupushū
- 90 - nihayushū
...

And since we're out of numbers after 99 (nihayushunihayū), the next thing to do is... duplicate!
- 100 - pashupashū
- 101 - pashupashupanū
- 102 - pashupashutenū
...
---
### And here's the thousand!
Logically we could just say "pashupashupashū" but that's almost a tongue twister, so instead, get your first syllable, and duplicate it, then put the duplicate behind the whole number
- 1000 - papashupashū (one one zero one zero / one thousand)

---
### Year Example

The year 2024 would be written as:

teteshuteshuhayū (two two zero two zero four / twenty twenty four)

---
### Clarifications

ū must always go at the end of the word.

shortening number pronunciations is fine, as long as you're being understood.
