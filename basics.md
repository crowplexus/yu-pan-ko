# YŪ"PAN"KŌ Basics

YŪ"PAN"KŌ" uses a simple version of the roman alphabet with fewer letters, those being:

### Vowels

A O I U E
### Consonants

P K T F H L M N R Y S

---

YŪ"PAN"KŌ also uses basic accent markers to indicate long vowels and nasal sounds

tilde (~) is used to indicate a nasal consonant/vowel, i.e: ñ

macron (-) is used to indicate a long vowel, i.e: ā

---

The language's verbs work like simple contractions in English
- i.e: It is -> It's

Within this structure, verbs are like suffixes, which attach to words in order to change their meaning without having to change the entire word, whenever you see a word starting in a dash in the dictionary, that means it's a verb.

Example usage for verbs:
- sa-hufun pūin | translation: I drink water
- satu-seren hunīs | translation: (The) human is honest
