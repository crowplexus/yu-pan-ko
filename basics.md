# Grammatically Allowed Syllables

you can combine any consonant with a vowel to form a syllable,

the only pairs that are grammatically incorrect / not possible are:
- "Yi" - Y and I make near identical sounds, making this pair redundant and nonsensical

"sh" + vowel is also allowed to be paired with consonants to make a syllable, and is considered as such.

---

YŪ"PAN"KŌ also uses basic accent markers to indicate long vowels and nasal sounds

tilde (~) is used to indicate a nasal consonant/vowel, i.e: ñ

macron (-) is used to indicate a long vowel, i.e: ā
- In many languages, this would be where the tonal syllable is.

# Verb Examples

The language's verbs work like simple contractions in English
- i.e: It is -> It's

Within this structure, verbs are like suffixes, which attach to words in order to change their meaning without having to change the entire word, whenever you see a word starting in a dash in the dictionary, that means it's a verb.

Example usage for verbs:
- pūin-hufun sa | I drink water
	- "pūin" is water
	- "-hufun" refers to the act of drinking something
	- sa is "me" or "I"
- hunishū-seren satu | The human is honest
	- hunishū is honest
	- "-seren" is to be
	- "satu" is human
- omipē-seren kanishō sa | I need to be strong
	- "omipē" is strong
	- "-seren" is to be
	- "kanishō" directly refers to need
	- "sa" is "me" or "I"
- fā-mapun pushū | They look like a star.
	- "fā" is star
	- "-mapun" is to look like
	- "pushū" is "he / her / they"
		- there is no grammatical gender, everyone is referred to as "pushū"
