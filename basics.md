# YŪ"PAN"KŌ Basics

YŪ"PAN"KŌ" uses a simple version of the roman alphabet with fewer letters, those being:

### Vowels

A O I U E
### Consonants

P K T F H L M N R Y S

# Grammatically Allowed Syllables

you can combine any consonant with a vowel to form a syllable,

the only pairs that are grammatically incorrect / not possible are:
- "Yi" - Y and I make near identical sounds, making this pair redundant and nonsensical

"sh" + vowel is also allowed to be paired with consonants to make a syllable, and is considered as such.

---

YŪ"PAN"KŌ also uses basic accent markers to indicate long vowels and nasal sounds

tilde (~) is used to indicate a nasal consonant/vowel, i.e: ñ

macron (-) is used to indicate a long vowel, i.e: ā
- In many languages, this would be where the tonal syllable is.

---

The language's verbs work like simple contractions in English
- i.e: It is -> It's

Within this structure, verbs are like suffixes, which attach to words in order to change their meaning without having to change the entire word, whenever you see a word starting in a dash in the dictionary, that means it's a verb.

Example usage for verbs:
- sa-hufun pūin | I drink water
- satu-seren hunishū | (The) human is honest
- sa-seren kanishō omipē | I need to be strong
- pushū-mapun fā | They look like a star.
