# Suffixes

Suffix examples down after this section

- "ño" - Suffix indicating a higher up of yours.
	- To use this, grab any word, remove the last long vowel within that noun, and add "ño" to the end.
	- Keep in mind, if the word ends in a consonant, you must remove that consonant in favour of the suffix
	- For example: "yū" becomes "yuño"
	- This would be equal to saying "Sir" or "Miss" - refers to a higher class.

- "shō" - Suffix indicating **regret**
	- Tells the listener that the speaker is saying whatever comes before "shō" regretfully
	- Like shaking your vocal cords when saying words
	- for example: "yūshō" is a regretful "No"

- "{same word twice}" - Suffix indicating **desperation**
	- To use this, simply say a noun twice
	- for example: "yuyū" is a desperate "No"

- "{duplicate middle/last vowel}" - Suffix indicating **certainty**
	- To use this, grab a noun, find it's middle/last vowel, and duplicate it
	- often, duplicating that vowel makes it be shorter than it originally was
	- For example: "yū" becomes "yūu"
